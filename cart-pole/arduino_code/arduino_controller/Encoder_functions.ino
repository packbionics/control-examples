   This function gets the absolute position from the AMT22 encoder using the SPI bus. The AMT22 position includes 2 checkbits to use
   for position verification. Both 12-bit and 14-bit encoders transfer position via two bytes, giving 16-bits regardless of resolution.
   For 12-bit encoders the position is left-shifted two bits, leaving the right two bits as zeros. This gives the impression that the encoder
   is actually sending 14-bits, when it is actually sending 12-bit values, where every number is multiplied by 4.
   This function takes the pin number of the desired device as an input
